### Note on Enrollment for On-Campus Students

These courses are listed in the course catalog as "Natural Language Processing-WB". They are partially asynchronous courses taught for certain online master's programs at UT ("Option III" programs, as the university calls them). If you are a student enrolled on-campus at UT Austin, you are not eligible to take this course. This is a hard requirement from the university due to the fact that this course is part of an Option III program. There is an on-campus version of CS388 that is typically taught once per year which you are eligible to take (or CS371N if you're an undergraduate student). Regardless, you are free to consult the materials here!
